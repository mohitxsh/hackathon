<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App -->

# Project Description

FaaS allows stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to boost productivity and efficiency. The data is collected directly through drones, satellites, farmers, market agents and government agencies. The gathered information is further processed and analysed to find what works well on the sector. The analysed information is leveraged by farmers to adopt precision farming practices to boost productivity, government to empower field officers to provide timely support, and corporates to optimise input application and real-time monitoring of crop output.

Farming as a Service offers innovative, professional-grade solutions for agricultural and allied services via a subscription or pay-per-use model.
•Some solutions are organized, efficient reinventions of existing practices, while others are tech-driven innovations.
• The first FaaS category is farm management solutions, which offer information sharing, analytics and precision farming tools. This involves information management between farmers, government, corporates, financial institutions and advisory bodies. The second FaaS category is production assistance, which offers on-farm resources to aid production. This involves equipment rental, labour services and utility services.

# Technology Used
## ReactJS





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
