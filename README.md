# Project Description

## FaaS allows stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to boost productivity and efficiency. The data is collected directly through drones, satellites, farmers, market agents and government agencies. The gathered information is further processed and analysed to find what works well on the sector. The analysed information is leveraged by farmers to adopt precision farming practices to boost productivity, government to empower field officers to provide timely support, and corporates to optimise input application and real-time monitoring of crop output.

## Farming as a Service offers innovative, professional-grade solutions for agricultural and allied services via a subscription or pay-per-use model.
•Some solutions are organized, efficient reinventions of existing practices, while others are tech-driven innovations.
• The first FaaS category is farm management solutions, which offer information sharing, analytics and precision farming tools. This involves information management between farmers, government, corporates, financial institutions and advisory bodies. The second FaaS category is production assistance, which offers on-farm resources to aid production. This involves equipment rental, labour services and utility services.
